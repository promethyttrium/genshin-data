  "description": "The Scions of the Canopy believe in and worship the Wayob, which manifests upon the land with the power of totems and Nightsouls.\\nIn the stories of the storytellers, Wayob manifestations often appear as the messengers of trials, or guides to the kingdom of the Lord of the Night. A Saurian-Crowned Warrior once said that he fought with a Wayob in a trance while practicing his skills, and in doing so, gained deeper understanding.\\nThe Scions of the Canopy believe their Wayob has the power to control the growth of fruits and leaves, and can also control the roots of crops and draw the patterns of the veins of leaves.",
