This branch of their genus was able to survive by adapting more toward earth-based living, and became known as the \"Wenut.\"\\nSome desert folk still mistakenly believe that Wenut is the final point of a quicksand eel's life cycle, likely due to superficial similarities between the species' behaviors.",
