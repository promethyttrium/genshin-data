  "description": "An elegant elemental life form that possesses immense elemental affinity. The long years have exposed it to high concentrations of Cryo, resulting in its present form.\\nIt is said that this entity is closest to the original form of a Frostnight Scion. It will use icy mists and crystals to set up redoubtable walls, but perhaps it does this only to separate the flawless primeval light from the world that lies beneath the moon.\\nIn still-extant prayers of the far north, it was born from the Frost Moon's blessings, symbolizing the pure source and the first radiance. Perhaps this is why it finds the tainting of its pale purity with the seven colors of heavenly light unbearable, thus rejecting all life that draws too close.",
