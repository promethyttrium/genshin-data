  "description": "An elegant elemental life form that possesses immense elemental affinity. The long years have exposed it to high concentrations of Electro, resulting in its present form.\\nOne of the manifestations with the most violent temperament, it commands steel-shattering bolts of lightning like mere servants, such that any land it passes through shall be marked as if by a marauding, thunderous calamity.\\nIn still-extant prayers of the far north, it was born from the Frost Moon's blessings, symbolizing the pure source and the first radiance. Perhaps this is why it finds the tainting of its pale purity with the seven colors of heavenly light unbearable, thus rejecting all life that draws too close.",
