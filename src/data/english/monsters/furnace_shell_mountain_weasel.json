  "description": "An ancient variant of mountain weasel that has adapted to a unique, Phlogiston-rich environment isolated from the outside world.\\nBy consuming creatures rich in Phlogiston, this species accumulates power in the shell it holds. After a prolonged existence in the ruins of the Sacred Mountain, its affinity for Phlogiston seems to have caused it to be influenced by the Source Mechanisms within the ruins, creating a unique symbiotic relationship between them.",
