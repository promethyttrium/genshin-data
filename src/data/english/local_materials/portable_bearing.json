  "name": "Portable Bearing",
  "description": "A portable bearing of a type that was mass-produced after the Fatui moved into Nod-Krai. Excessively worn units are discarded like obsolete personnel.<br/>A few of them have a vestige of kuuvahki left inside. As they are difficult to imitate, they are occasionally used as currency by merchants in Nasha Town.<br/>It's said that people tried to forge these bearings for that reason, but went bankrupt in the end because the cost of forging them was higher than their market value.",
