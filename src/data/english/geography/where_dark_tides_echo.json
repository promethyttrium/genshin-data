Just as a tiny chick that will one day become a soaring eagle is hatched from an egg, so are grand and radiant ambitions hatched in a dark and cramped place.\nThe people of Poisson are like the residents of the Fleuve Cendre, and from the history of these places they understand that some things are worth being, and indeed must be, fought for and bought by blood.",
