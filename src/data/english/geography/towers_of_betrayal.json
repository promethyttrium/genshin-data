  "description": "These huge obelisks have been standing here since the death of King Deshret. The desert dwellers call them the \"Towers of Betrayal\" and regard them as symbols of shame that serve as constant reminders of the fact that the desert kings had broken their oath with King Deshret...\nThe obelisks' true history could date back to a period preceding that of those short-lived desert kingdoms, but it has unfortunately long been forgotten.",
