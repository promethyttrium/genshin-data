  "description": "A wrought iron bed commonly found at The Flagship in Nasha Town. It comes with a cushion that's neither too hard nor too soft. As some of the tavern's patrons have put it, \"It's not the most comfortable, but it's not awful either.\"\\nFor anyone too exhausted — or inebriated — to care, a sturdy surface that won't suddenly give out beneath them is more than good enough.",
