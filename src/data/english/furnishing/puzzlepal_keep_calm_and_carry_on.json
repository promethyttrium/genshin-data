  "description": "A doll modeled on Faruzan combined with a popular Floating Hydro Fungus toy beloved by students. It is fully equipped for autonomous operation, featuring built-in walking mechanisms, weight sensors, terrain recognition, and remote control capabilities.\\nA collaboration between the Puzzlers' League and the Synopsium on Ruin Mechanisms, this Puzzlepal is a high-tech creation that still retains its adorable charm. The very sight of such a whimsical take on Faruzan by one's side while journeying through dark, creepy ruins should be enough to ease even the most frayed of nerves.",
