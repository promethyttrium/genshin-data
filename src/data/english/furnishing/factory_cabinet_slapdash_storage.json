  "description": "A storage cabinet made entirely of sheet metal that can be found throughout the Kuuvahki Experimental Design Bureau. Its upper section functions as a spacious cabinet, while its lower part comprises a pair of drawers.\\nFor those only recently introduced to storage cabinets like this one, the first organization drive is usually a neat and orderly affair, but over time, things tend to pile up haphazardly until the next major reorganization.",
