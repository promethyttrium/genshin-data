  "description": "A dancer standee that serves as a symbol of the \"Dance Dance Dynamic Disco\" dance exchange event jointly organized by Natlan's People of the Springs, Flower-Feather Clan, and Children of Echoes in partnership with the Sumeru Eremites' Blazing Beasts. This standee captures the graceful lines of the Sumeru dance consultant Nilou in mid-dance.\\nThis dancer from a far-off land expresses herself through movements entirely unlike those the tribes of Natlan are used to. Yet, the calm and airy emotion she seeks to express feels instantly familiar â€” and she even manages to evoke a rare and tranquil stillness akin to the calm surface of Ameyalco Waters.\\nAvid dancers exploring new dance moves and uncovering unexpected expression in seemingly gentle movements is precisely the reason the organizers are so passionate about this event.",
