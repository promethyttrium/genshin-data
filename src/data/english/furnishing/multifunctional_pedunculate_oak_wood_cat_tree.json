  "description": "A cat tree primarily made of pedunculate oak wood that acts as a scratching post, launchpad, and jungle gym for cats.\\nAccording to its maker, this cat tree has been \"consistently well reviewed\" by its pointy-eared users since its launch.\\nHow did the maker gather this... feedback, one might ask? Simple: besides repeat purchases from cat lovers, they placed the cat tree in spots where cats frequently hang out. A little observation was all it took to see just how popular the cat tree truly is.",
