  "description": "A rather unique jukebox found at The Flagship in Nasha Town. It comes with four speakers, each facing a different direction and tuned to distinct frequency ranges to create a richly layered listening experience.\\nDifferent musical styles, when paired with lighting, can dramatically transform the tavern's atmosphere to suit the moods of its patrons as they drink. To this end, the Flagship's jukebox offers a broad selection, ranging from the elegant to the dynamic, grand, and lighthearted.",
