  "description": "A rocking chair that can be found at the Curatorium of Secrets in Nasha Town. Its smooth, flowing lines are topped with four soft cushions for comfortable reclining.\\nOnce you settle into this chair, something special happens. It feels as though your head and limbs are gently enveloped in something soft and cushiony. Close your eyes, and it's easy to imagine you're no longer on solid ground, but aboard a boat made of clouds, drifting through the sky... until, before long, you naturally slip into dreamland.",
